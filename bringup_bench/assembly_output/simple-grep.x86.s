	.ascii	"Kurt Vonnegut\nSpeech to Class of 1994: Syracuse University "
	.ascii	"Commencement\nSunday, May 8th, 1994\nThere are three things "
	.ascii	"that I very much want to say to the Class of 1994 in this br"
	.ascii	"ief hail and farewell. They are things which haven\342\200\231"
	.ascii	"t been said enough to you freshly minted graduates nor to yo"
	.ascii	"ur parents or guardians, nor to me, nor to your teachers. I "
	.ascii	"will say these in the body of my speech, I\342\200\231m just"
	.ascii	" setting you up for this.\n\nFirst, I will say thank you. Se"
	.ascii	"cond, I will say I am truly sorry - now that is the striking"
	.ascii	" novelty among the three. We live in a time when nobody ever"
	.ascii	" seems to apologize for anything; they just weep and raise h"
	.ascii	"ell on the Oprah Winfrey Show. The third thing I want to say"
	.ascii	" to you at some point - probably close to the end - is, \"We"
	.ascii	" love you.\" Now if I fail to say any of those three things "
	.ascii	"in the body of this great speech, hold up your hands, and I "
	.ascii	"will remedy the deficiency.\n\nAnd I\342\200\231m going to a"
	.ascii	"sk you to hold up your hands this early in the proceedings f"
	.ascii	"or another reason.  I first declare to you that the most won"
	.ascii	"derful thing, the most valuable thing you can get from an ed"
	.ascii	"ucation is this - the memory of one person who could really "
	.ascii	"teach, whose lessons made life and yourselves much more inte"
	.ascii	"resting and full of possibilities than you had previously su"
	.ascii	"pposed possible.  I ask this of everyone here, including all"
	.ascii	" of us up here on the platform - How many of us, how many of"
	.ascii	" you, had such a teacher?  Kindergarten counts. Please hold "
	.ascii	"up your hands. Hurry. You may want to remember the name of t"
	.ascii	"hat great teacher.\n\nI thank you for being educated. There,"
	.ascii	" I\342\200\231ve thanked you now; that way I don\342\200\231"
	.ascii	"t have to speak to a bunch of nincompoops. For you freshly m"
	.ascii	"inted college graduates, this is a puberty ceremony long ove"
	.ascii	"rdue. We, whose principal achievement is that we are older t"
	.ascii	"han you, have to acknowledge at last that you are grown-ups,"
	.ascii	" too.  there are old poops possibly among us on this very da"
	.ascii	"y who will say that you are not grown-ups until you have som"
	.ascii	"ehow survived,"
	.ascii	" as they have, some famous calamity - The Great Depression, "
	.ascii	"World War II, Vietnam, whatever. Storytellers are responsibl"
	.ascii	"e for this destructive, not to say suicidal, myth. Again and"
	.ascii	" again in stories, after some terrible mess, the character i"
	.ascii	"s able to say at last, \"Today, I am a woman; today I am a m"
	.ascii	"an.  The end.\"\n\nWhen I got home from World War II, my Unc"
	.ascii	"le Dan clapped me on the back, and he said, \"You\342\200\231"
	.ascii	"re a man now.\" So I killed him. Not really, but I certainly"
	.ascii	" felt like doing it.\n\nNow you young twerps want a new name"
	.ascii	" for your generation?  Probably not, you just want jobs, rig"
	.ascii	"ht? Well, the media do us all such tremendous favors when th"
	.ascii	"ey call you Generation X, right?  Two clicks from the very e"
	.ascii	"nd of the alphabet. I hereby declare you Generation A, as mu"
	.ascii	"ch at the beginning of a series of astonishing triumphs and "
	.ascii	"failures as Adam and Eve were so long ago.\n\nI apologize. I"
	.ascii	" said I would apologize; I apologize now. I apologize becaus"
	.ascii	"e of the terrible mess the planet is in. But it has always b"
	.ascii	"een a mess. There have never been any \"Good Old Days,\" the"
	.ascii	"re have just been days. And as I say to my grandchildren, \""
	.ascii	"Don\342\200\231t look at me.  I just got here myself.\"\n\nS"
	.ascii	"o you know what I\342\200\231m going to do? I declare everyb"
	.ascii	"ody here a member of Generation A.  Tomorrow is another day "
	.ascii	"for all of us.\n\nHaving said that, I have made us, for a fe"
	.ascii	"w hours at least, what most of us do not have and what we ne"
	.ascii	"ed so desperately - I have made us an extended family, one f"
	.ascii	"or all and all for one. A husband, a wife and some kids is n"
	.ascii	"ot a family; it\342\200\231s a terribly vulnerable survival "
	.ascii	"unit. Now those of you who get married or are married, when "
	.ascii	"you fight with your spouse, what each of you will be saying "
	.ascii	"to the other one actually is, \"You\342\200\231re not enough"
	.ascii	" people.  You\342\200\231re only one person. I should have h"
	.ascii	"undreds of people around.\"\n\nI met a man and a wife in Nig"
	.ascii	"eria - Ibos. They just had a new baby. They had a thousand r"
	.ascii	"elatives there in southern Nigeria, and they were going to t"
	.ascii	"ake that baby around and visit all "
	.ascii	"the other relatives. We should all have families like that.\n"
	.ascii	"\nNow, you take Dan and Marilyn Quayle, who imagine themselv"
	.ascii	"es as a brave, clean-cut little couple. They are surrounded "
	.ascii	"by an enormous extended family, what we should all have - I "
	.ascii	"mean judges, senators, newspaper editors, lawyers, bankers. "
	.ascii	"They are not alone.  And one reason they are so comfortable "
	.ascii	"is that they are members of extended families, and I would r"
	.ascii	"eally, over the long run, hope America would find some way t"
	.ascii	"o provide all of our citizens with extended families - a lar"
	.ascii	"ge group of people they could call on for help.\n\nNow, I\342"
	.ascii	"\200\231ve made us an extended family. Does our family have "
	.ascii	"a flag?  Well, you bet.  It\342\200\231s a big orange rectan"
	.ascii	"gle. Orange is a very good color and maybe the best one. It\342"
	.ascii	"\200\231s full of vitamin C and cheerful associations, if on"
	.ascii	"e could forget the troubles in Ireland.\n\nNow this gatherin"
	.ascii	"g is a work of art. The teacher whose name I mentioned when "
	.ascii	"we all remembered good teachers asked me one time, \"What is"
	.ascii	" it artists do?\" And I mumbled something. \"They do two thi"
	.ascii	"ngs,\" he said. \"First, they admit they can\342\200\231t st"
	.ascii	"raighten out the whole universe. And then second, they make "
	.ascii	"at least one little part of it exactly as it should be. A bl"
	.ascii	"ob of clay, a square of canvas, a piece of paper, or whateve"
	.ascii	"r.\" We have all worked so hard and well to make these momen"
	.ascii	"ts and this place exactly what it should be.\n\nAs I have to"
	.ascii	"ld you, I had a bad uncle named Dan, who said a male can\342"
	.ascii	"\200\231t be a man unless he\342\200\231d gone to war. But I"
	.ascii	" had a good uncle named Alex, who said, when life was most a"
	.ascii	"greeable - and it could be just a pitcher of lemonade in the"
	.ascii	" shade - he would say, \"If this isn\342\200\231t nice, what"
	.ascii	" is?\" So I say that about what we have achieved here right "
	.ascii	"now. If he hadn\342\200\231t said that so regularly, maybe f"
	.ascii	"ive or six times a month, we might not have paused to notice"
	.ascii	" how rewarding life can be sometimes. Perhaps my good uncle "
	.ascii	"Alex will live on in some of you members of the Syracuse Cla"
	.ascii	"ss of 1994 if, in the future, you will paus"
	.ascii	"e to say out loud every so often, \"If this isn\342\200\231t"
	.ascii	" nice, what is?\"\n\nNow, my time is up and I haven\342\200\231"
	.ascii	"t even inspired you with heroic tales of the past - Teddy Ro"
	.ascii	"osevelt\342\200\231s cavalry charge up San Juan Hill, Desert"
	.ascii	" Storm - nor given you visions of a glorious future - comput"
	.ascii	"er programs, interactive TV, the information superhighway, s"
	.ascii	"peed the day. I spent too much time celebrating this very mo"
	.ascii	"ment and place - once the future we dreamed of so long ago. "
	.ascii	"This is it. We\342\200\231re here. How the heck did we do it"
	.ascii	"?\n\nA neighbor of mine, I hired him - he was a handyman - t"
	.ascii	"o build and \"L\" on my house where I could write.  He did t"
	.ascii	"he whole damn thing - he built the foundation, and then the "
	.ascii	"side walls and the roof.  He did it all by himself. And when"
	.ascii	" it was all done, he stood back and he aid, \"How the hell d"
	.ascii	"id I ever do that?\" How the hell did we ever do this?  We d"
	.ascii	"id it! And if this isn\342\200\231t nice, what is?\n\nI got "
	.ascii	"a letter from a sappy woman a while back - she knew I was sa"
	.ascii	"ppy too, which is to say a lifelong Democrat. She was pregna"
	.ascii	"nt, and she wanted to know if I thought it was a mistake to "
	.ascii	"bring a little baby into a world as troubled as this one is."
	.ascii	" And I replied, what made being alive almost worthwhile for "
	.ascii	"me was the saints I met. They could be almost anywhere. By s"
	.ascii	"aints I meant people who behaved decently and honorably in s"
	.ascii	"ocieties which were so often obscene. Perhaps many of us her"
	.ascii	"e, regardless of our ages or power or wealth, can be saints "
	.ascii	"for her child to meet.\n\nThere was one thing I forgot to sa"
	.ascii	"y, and I promised I would say, ant that is, \"We love you. W"
	.ascii	"e really do.\"\n"
