Summary of Everything We Did Since the Last Recap
1. Refining the Dependency Installation Process

    Simplified getdependencies_vl.sh
        Removed unnecessary dependencies (Vim, cross-compilers, pip, virtualenv).
        Used Conda for xz, setuptools, and devtools.
        Retained QEMU (qemu-user & qemu-user-static), as they require sudo installation.
        Installed Python dependencies via pip using requirements.txt and editable install (-e .).

2. Fixing the Package Structure

    Discovered that hippo/ was incorrectly treated as the package, but the actual package should include:
        guess_and_sketch/
        solver/
        training/
    Updated setup.py to reflect the correct package structure.

3. Verifying Package Installation

    Uninstalled and reinstalled the package properly:

    bash
    CopyEdit
    pip uninstall guesssketch
    pip install -e hippo/

    Successfully imported and tested:

    bash
    CopyEdit
    python -c "import guess_and_sketch; print('GuessSketch Loaded!')"
    python -c "import solver; print('Solver Loaded!')"
    python -c "import training; print('Training Loaded!')"

        âœ… Everything loaded correctly.

4. Cleaning Up Unnecessary Scripts

    Removed outdated scripts:
        getconda_vl.sh (since Conda is already installed).
        Cross-compilation scripts (assemble_binary_vl.sh, compile_assembly_vl.sh).
        fix_missing_headers.sh, test_unixcmds_vl.sh, qemu_execute_vl.sh.
    Kept only:
        getdependencies_vl.sh (for dependency installation).
        install_gmp.sh (in case GMP is required).
