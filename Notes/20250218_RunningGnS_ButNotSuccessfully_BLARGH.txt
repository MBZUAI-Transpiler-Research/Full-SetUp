‚úÖ Step 1: Running the Transpiler

    Goal: Execute the transpiler to translate RISC-V to ARM using the Guess & Sketch method.
    Command Used:

    python hippo/main.py --guess \
    --source_lang risc --target_lang arm \
    --data_file json_files/euler.json \
    --predictions_folder guess_and_sketch/proj_euler \
    --model_name_or_path celinelee/bartlarge_armtorisc_cloze2048 \
    --max_length 2048

    Outcome: The script ran but encountered errors.

‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Identifying Errors
üõë Issue #1: Regex SyntaxWarnings

    Problem: Multiple invalid escape sequences (\s, \.) in regex patterns.
    Affected Files:
        hippo/guess_and_sketch/guess_and_sketch.py
        hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py
        hippo/solver/global_fixes.py
        hippo/guess_and_sketch/assembly_regexes.py
    Root Cause: Strings like:

re.compile('\s+')  # Incorrect

should be raw strings:

    re.compile(r'\s+')  # Correct

    Plan: Fix every re.compile( instance in the affected files.

‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Attempted Fix for Regex Warnings
‚úÖ What We Did Right

    Identified 55 instances of re.compile( in sketches_to_rosette.py using:

grep -c "re.compile(" hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py

Proposed a bulk find-and-replace solution using sed:

    sed -i 's/re\.compile(/re.compile(r(/g' hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py

    Verified that this approach would apply raw strings to every regex.

‚ùå What Went Wrong

    The sed command introduced syntax errors:
        Applied r( incorrectly inside formatted string literals (f"").
        Affected more than just regex patterns, possibly breaking valid code.

‚ö†Ô∏è Step 4: Dealing with Broken Code
What We Should Have Done Instead

    Manually Review Before Bulk Replacement
        Instead of blindly running sed, we should have:

    grep "re.compile(" hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py

    Checked which lines needed fixing and manually adjusted risky ones.

Backup Before Making Changes

    We should have backed up the file before running sed:

    cp hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette_backup.py

Verify Fixes Before Running Again

    We should have checked the diff:

        git diff hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py

        Then tested syntax before rerunning the transpiler.

üî• Current Status & Next Steps

‚úÖ What Worked:

    Successfully identified Regex syntax issues.
    Found all re.compile( instances that needed fixing.

‚ùå What Went Wrong:

    Bulk replacement introduced new errors, making things worse.
    Now need to revert and fix the regex manually.

üîú Next Steps for Tomorrow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Revert changes to sketches_to_rosette.py:

git checkout -- hippo/solver/sketches_to_rosette.py

2Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Fix Regex Issues (Without Breaking Code)

    Go through the grep results and only modify regex patterns.
    Ensure each re.compile() uses a raw string (r"...").

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the transpiler again and check errors.

    If new errors appear, debug line by line instead of bulk fixes.

üí° Lessons Learned

    Don‚Äôt rush bulk code edits‚Äîespecially on regex-heavy files.
    Backup before making major changes.
    Verify fixes line by line instead of blindly applying global changes.
