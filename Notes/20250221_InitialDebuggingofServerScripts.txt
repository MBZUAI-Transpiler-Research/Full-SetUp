Context: Running a Transpiler Project Remotely

You are trying to replicate a transpiler project that you successfully set up and compiled locally. However, when running it on a remote server with GPU access, you encountered errors in one of the scripts.
Key Issues and Debugging Steps
1️⃣ Initial Issues

    Script failing on the remote server.
    Mismatch between local and remote environments (e.g., dependencies, Python versions, CUDA).
    Errors in guess_and_sketch.py related to cross-attention layers.

## ALSO!!!! Worth noting that ft_model.py uses prepare_model_for_int8_training which is deprecated! using prepare_model_for_kbit_training instead

2️⃣ Fixing the Alignment Layer Issue

    Your model has 12 layers (indexed 0-11), but alignment_layer was set to 17, which was out of range.
    We changed it to:

    python
    CopyEdit
    alignment_layer = 10
    alignment_head = 14

        This fixed the out-of-bounds error and moved execution forward.

3️⃣ Encountered JSON Serialization Error

    The script attempted to save a PyTorch Tensor into a JSON file, which is not supported.
    Solution: Convert all tensors into lists before saving:

    python
    CopyEdit
    def convert_tensors(obj):
        if isinstance(obj, torch.Tensor):
            return obj.tolist()
        elif isinstance(obj, list):
            return [convert_tensors(i) for i in obj]
        elif isinstance(obj, dict):
            return {k: convert_tensors(v) for k, v in obj.items()}
        return obj

    We modified guess_and_sketch.py to apply convert_tensors(problem_prediction) before saving the JSON.

4️⃣ Encountered NameError: name 'convert_tensors' is not defined

    The function was not defined properly inside the class.
    Fix: Ensure it is a class method by adding self:

    python
    CopyEdit
    class GuessAndSketch:
        def convert_tensors(self, obj):
            if isinstance(obj, torch.Tensor):
                return obj.tolist()
            elif isinstance(obj, list):
                return [self.convert_tensors(i) for i in obj]
            elif isinstance(obj, dict):
                return {k: self.convert_tensors(v) for k, v in obj.items()}
            return obj

    Ensure you call it as self.convert_tensors(problem_prediction) instead of just convert_tensors(problem_prediction) inside the class.

5️⃣ Running Again

    After applying the fixes, you ran the script again and it progressed further but hit another issue:

    plaintext
    CopyEdit
    BartModel is using BartSdpaAttention, but torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention does not support output_attentions=True

    This is a warning, not a blocking error. It suggests that in future versions of transformers, manual attention selection will be required.
    Execution proceeded but failed again at JSON serialization, which suggests some nested structure still contained tensors.

6️⃣ Possible Final Fix

    Ensure everything in problem_prediction is fully converted before saving:

    python
    CopyEdit
    problem_prediction = self.convert_tensors(problem_prediction)

    Run the script again.

Final Thoughts

    Your initial errors were due to misaligned layer selection and Tensor JSON serialization issues.
    Fixing alignment_layer and adding convert_tensors as a class method helped move things forward.
    You are now at a final debugging step for serialization—after this, things should work as expected.
