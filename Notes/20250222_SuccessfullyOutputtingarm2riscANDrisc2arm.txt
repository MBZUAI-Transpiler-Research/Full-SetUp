1. Getting the Conda Environment Up and Running

    You initially mentioned that you did conda init, but it wasnâ€™t working.
    We encountered an issue where running conda activate resulted in errors, and I helped you with several troubleshooting steps:
        Source the Conda Script: We tried running source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but that didn't work as expected. We finally used . $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, which helped resolve the issue.
        Confirming Conda Initialization: After that, you were able to activate your environment using conda activate transpiler_env.

2. Checking for Memory Issues

    You mentioned running into CUDA memory errors while processing the euler.json file, especially with larger programs like problem #11.
    We explored potential fixes and ways to clear memory, including adding the following lines:
        torch.cuda.empty_cache() and gc.collect() in relevant places within your code to release memory after processing large chunks.
    You also encountered reserved but unallocated memory as a possible culprit, and I suggested using the PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True" environment variable to address memory fragmentation.

3. Running ARM to RISC Translation

    Once the environment was properly set up and memory issues were addressed, you ran the ARM to RISC translation using:

    bash

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python hippo/main.py --guess \
        --source_lang arm --target_lang risc \
        --data_file json_files/euler.json \
        --predictions_folder test_folder \
        --k 3 \
        --model_name_or_path "celinelee/bartlarge_armtorisc_cloze2048" \
        --max_length 2048 \
        --is_enc_dec

    This ran successfully and generated the corresponding output files for ARM to RISC translation in the test_folder.

4. Running RISC to ARM Translation

    After successfully processing the ARM to RISC translation, we switched to the RISC to ARM translation.
    You ran the following command after setting the environment variable and ensuring the output folder was in place:

    bash

    export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True"
    mkdir -p test_folder_risc_to_arm
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python hippo/main.py --guess \
        --source_lang risc --target_lang arm \
        --data_file json_files/euler.json \
        --predictions_folder test_folder_risc_to_arm \
        --k 3 \
        --model_name_or_path "celinelee/bartlarge_risctoarm_cloze2048" \
        --max_length 2048 \
        --is_enc_dec

    The RISC to ARM translation also worked as expected, and the corresponding output files were placed in the test_folder_risc_to_arm.

5. Memory Considerations and Improvements

    Throughout this process, we carefully considered memory management.
    After noticing significant memory usage, we fine-tuned memory handling by adding torch.cuda.empty_cache() and gc.collect() in strategic places.
    You experienced a CUDA out of memory error in larger problems (e.g., problem #11), which we handled by adjusting memory configurations and clearing unused memory after certain operations.

6. Confirmation of Working Outputs

    After processing both translations, you successfully generated the JSON output files in both test_folder (ARM to RISC) and test_folder_risc_to_arm (RISC to ARM).
    The files were listed correctly under both folders, confirming that both translation tasks had completed without significant issues.

Key Actions Taken:

    Fixed Conda Setup: Ensured conda was properly initialized and the environment activated.
    Memory Management: Added commands to manage GPU memory efficiently (torch.cuda.empty_cache() and gc.collect()).
    Executed ARM to RISC Translation: Successfully ran the ARM to RISC translation, generating the output JSON files.
    Executed RISC to ARM Translation: Ran the RISC to ARM translation with the correct model and generated the respective output files.
    Environment Variable for Memory: We used PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True" to help with memory fragmentation.

Conclusion:

    You now have successfully generated both ARM to RISC and RISC to ARM translation outputs.
    We carefully handled memory management, avoided overloading the GPU, and ensured that both tasks completed without major issues.
    The process is looking smooth now, with output files located in the respective folders.
