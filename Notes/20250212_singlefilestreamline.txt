EDITOR'S NOTE. I generally ask for ChatGPT's help in making these summaries, but this one is rather bubbly. Please substitute my usual misanthropic sarcasm in lieu of this saccharine commentary.

🚀 Summary of Today's Work on the Transpiler Project
🔹 What We Did Today

Today, we successfully set up, compiled, linked, and executed the full transpiler project pipeline on your local machine. The workflow included:

    Setting up GitHub & Conda
        Created a new GitHub repository and ensured proper SSH authentication.
        Installed Miniconda, created a crosscompilers environment, and set up dependencies.

    Building the Full Setup Process
        Designed and structured setup_master_vl.sh to automate the entire workflow.
        Integrated all key steps:
            Installing dependencies (getdependencies_vl.sh)
            Compiling source code into assembly (compile_assembly.sh)
            Assembling binaries (assemble_binary.sh)
            Generating verbose assembly output (compile_verbose_assembly.sh)
            Running executables with QEMU (qemu_execute_vl.sh)

    Running & Debugging the Scripts
        We deleted old files to start fresh.
        Successfully ran setup_master_vl.sh and executed all scripts in sequence.

🔹 Issues & How We Fixed Them
1️⃣ GitHub SSH Issues

    Problem: Couldn't push to the repository without entering credentials repeatedly.
    Fix: Set up SSH authentication and changed the Git remote to use SSH.
    Result: Now, Git operations (push/pull) work without needing a password.

2️⃣ getdependencies_vl.sh Missing Project Name

    Problem: setup_master_vl.sh called getdependencies_vl.sh, but it required a project name argument.
    Fix: We updated setup_master_vl.sh to check for an argument and pass it properly.
    Result: The script now runs with the correct project name and doesn’t fail on missing arguments.

3️⃣ Ensuring QEMU & Cross-Compilers Are Installed

    Problem: Some scripts didn’t check if QEMU and cross-compilers were installed, leading to potential runtime errors.
    Fix: Added command -v checks in the scripts to ensure required tools were installed.
    Result: The scripts now stop early if critical dependencies are missing, avoiding wasted execution.

4️⃣ Handling Missing & Empty Files

    Problem: Some scripts assumed files (like names.txt, words.txt, or .s files) existed but didn’t verify them.
    Fix: Added checks for missing files before running commands.
    Result: The pipeline now downloads missing files and exits cleanly if required files are absent.

🔹 What Went Right

✅ Smooth automation: setup_master_vl.sh successfully runs all steps in order.
✅ No missing dependencies: Ensured all required packages and tools are installed.
✅ Correct compilation & execution: All assembly and binary files generated and ran successfully.
✅ Project is now fully structured: Everything is organized, modular, and easily re-runnable.

🔹 Where We Currently Stand
💯 Status: Everything Works!

    We fully automated the compilation pipeline.
    The final output showed all executables running successfully.
    The GitHub repo is correctly set up, and everything is version-controlled.


🎉 Final Takeaway

We now have a fully automated transpiler setup that can be run anytime with a single command:

./setup_master_vl.sh hippo

Everything is clean, modular, and relatively streamlined.
