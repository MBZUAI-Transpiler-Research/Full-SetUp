Summary of Work (AFTER the Last Summary)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Unix Command Testing

    Created a comprehensive test script (test_unixcmds.sh) to automatically verify compiled binaries.
    Structured testing for cat, cd, cp, ls, mkdir, ps, rm, rmdir, touch, tee, and xargs.
    Improved validation by checking file creation, deletion, timestamps, and process listing output.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Fixing tee.c & xargs.c Testing Issues

    Realized both required manual input, making automation difficult.
    Instead of forcing an automated approach, added instructions to the test script so users can run them interactively.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Finalized touch.c Testing

    Added sleep 3 before modifying timestamps.
    Ensured timestamp visibility with seconds using ls --full-time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Refined the Main Setup Script (addingunix_master_vl.sh)

    Linked test_unixcmds.sh into the full pipeline.
    Improved script modularity and error handling.
    Made sure Conda properly initializes before activation.
    Introduced a helper function (make_executable_and_run) to reduce redundant chmod +x calls.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Validated Everything Works End-to-End

    Ran all scripts together to confirm compilation, assembly, and testing.
    Checked that both ARM and RISC-V binaries execute properly in QEMU.
    Finalized cleanup procedures to remove test files after execution.

‚úÖ Current Status:

üíØ Full Unix command transpilation, cross-compilation, and testing pipeline is operational!
üîÑ Reusable setup for future extensions!
