üõë Issue: Out-of-Memory (OOM) Errors During Model Execution
üîç Observations
You attempted to run Qwen2.5 (1.5B model) on an A100 80GB GPU, but consistently encountered CUDA Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors.
The model successfully loaded with only ~1.1GB allocated, but it crashed during inference (generate()), consuming nearly all 80GB of VRAM.
The softmax operation inside the attention mechanism caused the crash, indicating excessive memory usage in attention computation.
‚ö†Ô∏è Key Symptoms
‚úÖ Model loads successfully (~1.1GB allocated, ~1.6GB reserved).
‚ùå Inference fails (OOM occurs inside the softmax function in attention).
VRAM explodes to 77.45GB before crashing.
Reducing max_length (2048 ‚Üí 1024) didn‚Äôt fix the issue.
CUDA memory was properly cleared, and no rogue Python processes were running.
GPU was free before running the model (checked with nvidia-smi).
Multiple settings tried, but inference remained the culprit.
üõ† What We Tried & The Results
Attempt #	Solution Tried	Why We Tried It	Result
1Ô∏è‚É£ Cleared CUDA Cache (torch.cuda.empty_cache())	Ensure VRAM is completely freed before running the model.	‚úÖ Worked, but didn‚Äôt prevent OOM during inference.	
**2Ô∏è‚É£ Checked Python Processes (`ps aux	grep python`)**	Ensure no other Python processes were holding GPU memory.	‚úÖ No rogue processes found.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Verified Environment (which python, which pip)	Ensure correct Conda environment (transpiler_env) is active.	‚úÖ Correct environment was in use.	
4Ô∏è‚É£ Applied 4-bit Quantization (BitsAndBytesConfig)	Reduce model size & memory usage by 50-75%.	‚úÖ Model loaded successfully but still crashed during inference.	
5Ô∏è‚É£ Changed device_map="balanced_low_0"	Optimize VRAM usage by spreading layers across GPU memory.	‚ùå Still OOM during inference.	
6Ô∏è‚É£ Moved First Layer to CPU (device_map={"transformer.h.0": "cpu"})	Reduce GPU memory pressure by offloading one layer.	‚ùå Had minimal effect; still crashed at inference.	
7Ô∏è‚É£ Reduced --max_length (2048 ‚Üí 1024)	Reduce memory allocated for the sequence length.	‚ùå Slight reduction, but OOM still occurred.	
8Ô∏è‚É£ Forced FP16 (torch_dtype=torch.float16)	bfloat16 might be more memory-intensive in some cases.	‚ùå No noticeable improvement over bfloat16.	
9Ô∏è‚É£ Changed device_map="sequential"	More conservative memory allocation strategy.	‚ùå Still crashed during inference.	
üîü Lowered Beam Search (--k 3 ‚Üí --k 1)	Beam search stores multiple hypotheses, drastically increasing memory usage.	(Testing now ‚Äì Expected to significantly reduce memory usage).	
1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Disabled output_attentions=True	Prevent storing massive attention matrices in memory.	(Testing now ‚Äì Should help prevent softmax OOM errors).	
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Enabled attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"	Optimize attention memory usage for large sequences.	(Testing now ‚Äì Should reduce attention memory usage).	
1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Lowered --max_length further (1024 ‚Üí 512)	Reduce attention matrix size, saving exponential memory.	(Testing now ‚Äì Should lower softmax memory footprint).	
üîÆ Expected Outcome From Final Fixes
Lowering beam search (--k 1) should prevent excessive sequence duplication in memory.
Disabling output_attentions=True should prevent large tensor accumulation.
Enabling attn_implementation="flash_attention_2" should optimize memory use in softmax computation.
Lowering --max_length (1024 ‚Üí 512) should prevent massive tensor sizes in attention.
üìå Final Thoughts
The main issue isn‚Äôt model loading‚Äîit‚Äôs memory explosion during inference (generate()).
The culprit is attention computation, particularly beam search and softmax inside scaled dot-product attention.
By reducing sequence length and using memory-efficient attention mechanisms, we should eliminate OOM errors.
If all else fails, the next step would be using torch.compile() with memory optimization flags or switching to DeepSpeed inference.
